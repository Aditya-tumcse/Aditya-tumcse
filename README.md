I am Brixen based computer vision and machine learning engineer with deep interests in multi-view geometry and geometric deep learning. I am working at Covision Lab in Brixen in Italy that builds 3D scanners.I recently graduated from my masters in computational science and engineering with focus on 3D computer vision and deep learning from TUM. I love to build highly efficient and production ready code.
